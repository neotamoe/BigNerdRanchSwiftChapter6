# Big Nerd Ranch - Swift - Chapter 6

This chapter reviewed for and while loops in Swift.  

## Learning Highlights
* using where with a for-in loop to further specify when to execute code
* while loop executes as long as the condition is true
* repeat while loops (AKA do-while loops)
* continue is a control transfer statement that stops the loop where it is and begins again from the top
* break in a loop will stop where it is an exit the loop

## Silver Challenge
I completed the SILVER challenge in this chapter which is the classic Fizz Buzz code exercise.
* Print Fizz if a number is divisible by 3.
* Print Buzz if a number is divisible by 5.
* Print Fizz Buzz if a number is divisible by both 3 and 5.
* For any other number, print the number.
